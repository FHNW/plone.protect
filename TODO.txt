- plone.app.portlets assignments not fully installed--will cause write after site is created
- quickinstaller uses bloody tools like view logic. That whole package should be rewritten, refactored
- only do the confirm redirect in certain cases:
    - text/html response
    - 301/302 response
    - reason: some things are safe to abort, not do confirm and redirect
- workflow changes need auth token injection
- portal_(css|javascript)
- poke through the ZMI and find everything that is broken--there will be a lot
